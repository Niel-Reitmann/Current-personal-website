Why go back to uni after 2+ years of industry experience in tech? 

I've had this question a few times now, great excuse to write a quick blog I can send around. 

There were three main considerations for me going back.

### E-3 pls

The big one is so I can get the E-3 visa and move to the US for a stint in my 20s.

This is probably the easiest visa for an Australian citizen to get to sf, and my blocker is that I need a bachelor's or higher degree in the specialty of work that I get a US job offer in.

Computer science would tick this box nicely. 

### I'm technical, I promise

Secondly, to improve on my technical ability / look like I have more technical ability.

This is mainly if I wanted to raise or work in product again since tech companies are getting stricter with the need to have some sort of technical background.

I doubt Atlassian would have considered me if I wasn't doing cs, and I don't disagree with this approach.

In the whole pm intern cohort, only one person didn't come from a technical background. 

### Frens

Another factor that’s of equal weighing is the social life, it only gets harder to spend so much recurring time with people my age.

### Other

An added bonus of being back at uni are the uni breaks! Even though UNSW kinda sucks for this. 

Travel is important to me, so I will be using these holidays well before getting back into full time work. 

Writing this from a hostel in Bilbao, Spain after hiking the Pyrenees for a few days. 

If it helps as context for why I didn’t go back to business, my year of business at UQ got credited to my computer science degree making it a 2, instead of 3, year degree. 

If that didn’t happen I probably wouldn’t have made the degree switch considering the opportunity cost of the extra year. 

Fun!
