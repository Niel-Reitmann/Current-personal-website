How did I end up at Startmate two months after turning 19? This writing serves as a recollection of the most significant events that led to my current position, primarily as a way for me to maintain a record.

I was born and raised in Cape Town, South Africa, where there weren't many opportunities for young people to pursue interesting work.

My parents decided we would move to Australia at the end of 2019. If you know a bit about South Africa, this decision will make sense. It's a beautiful country, but it's moving in an unfortunate direction.

### Sunshine Coast (2019-2021)

My brother and I completed grades 11 and 12 on the Sunshine Coast in Queensland. This was a significant change. Here, young people could actually work and earn money.

It was a big change, and frankly, quite exciting for us. I did an eight-month stint at Domino's doing e-bike deliveries, and I remember how incredible it felt to be paid $11 an hour compared to the $2 minimum wage back home.

During this time, I started having coffees with people doing cool stuff, mainly those I met through church. My dad also introduced my brother and me to a local co-working space, the Digital Hub in Peregian.

It was there that I first heard about Startmate from _[Vinko Grgic](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vinkogrgic/)._

This was also when I met a key friend of mine, _[Wilson Symonds](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wilson-symonds/)_, who shared a similar ambition and interest in financial freedom with my brother and me.

I recall the three of us sitting in a room together, deciding which skills we would need to move away from retail and hospitality. My brother ventured into digital marketing, I delved into web development, and Wilson pursued property.

**The combination of these pursuits led to the first wave of opportunities for me:**

(1) Freelance web development for a local copywriter & work experience at a local agency → the local copywriter was a friend's mom, and the work experience was through school at the end of grade 11.

(2) Interning/work experience at a local real estate design & construction firm → following a coffee meeting with someone from church. I did this for eight months after school.

(3) Interning, and eventually working in sales, at a local apparel startup called _[Abide](https://www.abideculture.com/)_ → this was also an introduction through church and connections from South Africa.

This got me hooked on the opportunities Australia had to offer.

Another significant event during this time was my school's career counselor encouraging two friends, my brother, and me to enter a pitch competition.

With some hesitation, we decided to compete, and the school drove us to UQ in Brisbane to kick it off. Our idea was _[Travelator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2agY80N9i4w&feature=youtu.be)_, a tourism tech company connecting local tourism influencers to adventure businesses.

We ended up working late into the night on the pitch deck and won $1,000. This was probably the moment I fell in love with the chaos of starting a project with close friends.

Shortly after, we participated in another competition and came close to partnering with Queensland's largest tourism provider.

However, this plan fizzled out when we faced our grade 12 exams.

### Brisbane (2022-2023)

After our exams, my brother and I moved to a college on the UQ campus in Brisbane for university. I decided to pursue a Bachelor of Advanced Business, not for any particular reason, but because it seemed broad enough, and I knew I liked business.

Through the first Travelator pitch competition we held at UQ, we learned about UQ's Innovation & Entrepreneurship Society (_[UQIES](https://www.facebook.com/uqiesociety)_), and some of the executives already knew us. We joined right away as executives.

During this time, I was having approximately 3-4 coffee meetings and calls with people every week. Compared to the coast, so much more was happening in Brisbane and at UQ.

Here, I was introduced to _[EarlyWork](https://www.earlywork.co/)_ by _[Felix Hall](https://www.linkedin.com/in/magic-felix/)_, where my excitement for the ecosystem grew even more.

**This environment led to the second wave of events:**

(1) Co-founding _[Flaming Galahs](https://galah.community/)_ with my brother and building a team with the support of the Digital Hub and a few investors.

(2) Participating in Blackbird _[Protostars](https://www.blackbird.vc/programs/protostars)_ and their first _[Sales Academy](https://www.blackbird.vc/blog/the-blackbird-sales-academy)_.

(3) Joining the Winter22 cohort of the _[Startmate Student Fellowship](https://www.startmate.com/student-fellowship)_.

(4) Becoming Brisbane's first community advisor for Earlywork.

(5) Organizing a Sydney trip for UQIES (UQ Innovation & Entrepreneurship Society) where approximately 15 students had the opportunity to visit BlackBird, Airtree, Canva, Atlassian, Folklore, Immutable, and more.

(6) Co-organizing a similar trip to Singapore where we had the chance to explore equivalent startups and VCs.

Flaming Galahs gained some great traction, but ultimately, I didn't have the drive to pursue it long-term. I didn't want to be tied down so early. I learned many valuable lessons during this period.

A conversation with _[Darcy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/darcy-douglas/)_, one of the UQIES executives planning to move to Sydney, made me realize that nothing was holding me back from doing the same, especially since I had only completed a year of university.

I enjoyed the Student Fellowship so much that I pitched some ideas to the Startmate team afterward to join them as a "Student in Residence," due to all the ideas I had to expand it. Unfortunately, that didn't work out.

Protostars provided me with office hours with _[Joel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joelconnolly/)_, Blackbird's creative director. Our conversation left me with a key takeaway: "go where the energy is" when you are young. This tipped me over, and I made the decision to defer university and start applying for positions in Sydney.

I applied for approximately 20 roles, trying to keep all my applications in areas I genuinely cared about, and I received rejection messages every few days. This became the norm at the end of my first year of university and into my holiday break.

The growth role at Startmate came up and moved to the top of my list. _[Cam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cameronensor/)_ on the team encouraged me to apply, even though I didn't feel I had the necessary experience and probably wouldn't have applied otherwise.

During this time, I was doing contract work for _[EntryLevel](https://www.entrylevel.net/)_, a job I was referred to through the Student Fellowship. It was probably my first real tech startup position with a top-tier team.

### Sydney (2023-present)

I convinced my parents that, to make this work, even though I didn't have any offers or accommodation yet, I needed to be in Sydney for in-person interviews. They supported this, and I flew to Sydney in late January this year. That very first weekend, I received a call from _[Phoebe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/phoebe-pincus-a84150170/)_ congratulating me on my role with Startmate.

Accommodation was a separate problem. A great spot opened up but garnered a lot of interest. It was with a group of other startup employees. I knew one of them through a series of Twitter introductions and another through Flaming Galahs. Even though they had already received around 40 applicants, they put everything on hold and allowed me to check out the room. The rest is history!

In hindsight, very little in this journey was intentional. I'll borrow a line from Paul Graham's _["How To Do Great Work"](http://www.paulgraham.com/greatwork.html)_: "If you're interested, you're not astray." I credit this, combined with some risk taking and providing ample opportunities for luck to strike, to what brought me here today.
