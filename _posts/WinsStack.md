We each hold ourselves accountable to a certain standard. A version of ourselves we feel we could/should be.

What this means is that in each action we either live up to this version of self, or we don't. Whether you feel yourself judging actions in this way or not.

The topic I want to explore are the effects of living up to or coming short of this version of self and the follow on effect it creates in our lives.

**Why we do things well**

An example that works quite well here is our schooling grade system. In grade 12, we each get an ATAR. This ATAR determines which Universities and degrees you can apply for following graduation.

The obvious value in getting an alright score here is exactly that, your optionality when choosing the next steps in your career through University. Or maybe you already know you want to do something that requires a certain score, it makes sense to hit this mark.

The less obvious but equally powerful value in performing here links back to my point that we each compare ourselves to an ideal version of who we could be.

If you perform in grade 12 to the subconcious standard of 'success' in your mind, you will be able to anchor on it for many years to come and it tends to create momemtum that pushes you in the direction of becoming more like this best version of yourself.

The psychological impact of living up to these standards versus experiencing a moral shortcoming can be more powerful than we realise and I've seen it in action. I'd argue the affect this has is more important to consider than the ATAR.

**Anchors**

Like I mentioned briefly above, the way I like to think about this is creating anchors throughout your life. Events where you lived up to your ideal self standards (can also think of these as your morals) in a certain area that you can reflect back on in hardships.

I'll go back to the ATAR example. I don't feel as though students who get a higher score here have any more potential than others who score lower BUT what they do have moving forward is the anchor of knowing they could achieve academically meaning they are less likely to fear learning difficult concepts.

They are less likely to doubt their ability and more often than not, confidence is the barrier to success, not intelligence.

**Moral shortcomings**

Another way to look at this is to minimise your moral shortcomings. This doesn't only apply in bigger life events but also just on a day to day basis.

If you set yourself the goal to run 30km weekly and sleep through your first morning run, this is a moral shortcoming. You are likely to feel bad for a while and stack more moral shortcomings on top of this event.

The opposite is also true hence the name of this piece. Wins stack. If you live up to a higher version of yourself, you are more likely to continue living up to this version of yourself as you slowly become whoever you've internalised you want to be.

**Change in thinking**

It's not an overly complex topic but one that I think is worth reflecting on. When you don't go for that run or work decently hard on that project, you aren't only missing out on the health or financial benefits, but you are missing out on a chance to build another anchor into your life and create the first win to a stack of wins.
