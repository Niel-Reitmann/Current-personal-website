We each hold ourselves accountable to a certain standard, a version of ourselves that we feel we could or should be.

What this means is that in each action, we either live up to this version of self or we don't, whether you find yourself judging actions in this way or not.

The topic I want to explore is the effects of living up to or falling short of this version of self and the impact it creates in our lives.

**Why we do things well**

An example that works quite well here is our schooling grade system. In grade 12, we each receive an ATAR. This ATAR determines which universities and degrees you can apply for after graduation.

The obvious value in achieving a decent score here is precisely that: it provides options when choosing the next steps in your career through university. Alternatively, if you already know you want to pursue something that requires a certain score, it makes sense to strive for that mark.

The less obvious but equally powerful value in performing well here relates back to my point that we all compare ourselves to an ideal version of who we could be.

If you meet the subconscious standard of "success" in your mind during grade 12, you will be able to anchor on that achievement for many years to come. It tends to generate momentum that propels you in the direction of becoming more like this best version of yourself.

The psychological impact of meeting these standards versus experiencing a moral failing can be more powerful than we realize. I would argue that the effect this has is more important to consider than the ATAR itself.

**Anchors**

The way I like to think about this is by creating anchors throughout your lifeâ€”events where you lived up to your ideal self (which can also be thought of as your morals) in a specific area that you can reflect back on during hardships.

Let's revisit the ATAR example. I don't believe that students who achieve higher scores have inherently more potential than those who score lower. However, what they do have moving forward is the anchor of knowing they can achieve academically, which makes them less likely to fear learning difficult concepts.

They are less likely to doubt their abilities, and more often than not, confidence becomes the barrier to success, not intelligence.

**Moral shortcomings**

Another way to look at this is to minimize your moral failings. This doesn't only apply to significant life events but also to day-to-day actions.

For instance, if you set a goal to run 30 kilometers weekly and sleep through your first morning run, that would be a moral failing. You are likely to feel bad for a while and stack more moral failings on top of this event.

The opposite is also true, hence the name of this piece. Wins stack. If you consistently live up to a higher version of yourself, you are more likely to continue doing so, gradually becoming the person you've internalized and aspired to be.

**Change in thinking**

It's not an overly complex topic, but one that I think is worth reflecting on. When you choose not to go for that run or don't put decent effort into a project, you are not only missing out on the health or financial benefits, but you are also missing an opportunity to build another anchor into your life and create the first win of which many will stack.
